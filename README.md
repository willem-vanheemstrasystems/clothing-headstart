### Main Colours

[Four Season Color Analysis system](https://infinitcloset.com/category/4-season-color-analysis/)

Your Type:

| YES | Winter |
| --- | --- |
| NO | Spring, Summer, Autumn |

#### Main Colour: [Winter](https://infinitcloset.com/4-season-color-analysis/winter-colour-palette-4-season-color-analysis/)

You will suit colors that are ***sharp***, ***clear*** and ***high contrast***. Winters can also wear ***black*** and ***pure white*** comfortably. If you feel that black overpowers you, but your overall coloring is cool, then you may fit better into Summer.

***Skin***: Winter skintone is cool or even olive undertones. You may have very light skin and a high contrast level with your hair and eyes, or an overall dark colouring. ***Light, cool***

***Hair***: Either very light blonde with no warm undertones (platinum, icy blondes) or dark brown to black. Ashy mid-brown brunettes can also fall into this category. The important bit is that there is no golden or copper undertones to the hair, though sometimes there are cool red undertones. ***Grey***

***Eyes***: Cool steel blue, clear blue, cool green or dark brown to black eyes. High contrast between the white of the eyes and the iris, the eyes are bright and jewel-like, not hazy. ***Clear Blue***

The Winter colour palette would suit people who fall into Deep Winter, Cool Winter and Bright Winter in the [12 Season Color Analysis system](https://infinitcloset.com/category/12-seasons-color-analysis/). If you are looking for a more specific palette and your colouring is more neutral than Cool Winter, check Dark or Bright Winter instead.
