Your Type (Skin Color and Hair Color):

| YES | Summer (Cool and Light) |

| NO | Spring (Warm and Light), Autumn (Warm and Dark), Winter (Cool and Dark) |

#### Main Colour: [Spring](https://infinitcloset.com/4-season-color-analysis/spring-colour-palette-4-season-color-analysis/)

#### Main Colour: [Summer](https://infinitcloset.com/4-season-color-analysis/summer-colour-palette-4-season-color-analysis/)

Role Models: ***Anthony Hopkins***

Summer is another light coloring group, but Summers are cool toned, rather than the warm Springs. 

***Do's and Don'ts***

Summers have an ethereal and delicate coloring that will suit best with ***cool, light, and soft shades***. 

Unfortunately, black and other dark colors, as well as electric colors and rich warm hues are overpowering for you. You might also want to skip earthy warm tones with yellow undertones.

***Eyes:*** 

Eyes will be ***some shade of blue or gray***, and you were probably blond as a child (and may still be blond). 

Do you know there are no brown-eyed Summers, but only blues and greens? There might be soft hazel or soft gray eyes, but its iris has a cloudy look. Also, its hazel shade is muddy and cool, leaning towards blue, green, or gray.

***Skin:***

The skin doesn’t have that golden quality of Spring, but instead, is ***pink***.

Summer skin tone is soft and light, ranging from the lightest porcelain to pale or neutral beige. They also have a translucent quality to their skin, with blue, rose, or pink undertone. If your porcelain skin can’t abide by the sun, or you have an ivory skin that freckles but fades fast, you’re likely a Summer.

A Summer with a pink beige skin might tan fast, but she usually gets a pink cast, not brown. Some Summers may be very fair, while others look pale and sallow. Most of the time, they have pink cheeks—and if they’ve got some freckles, they are rosy or even charcoal gray.

The Summer color range is similar to Spring, but the colors are cooler in tone. For example, a Spring’s red tones will have some orange in them, but Summer’s will be slightly blue. 

***Hair:*** 

Most Summers have ***blonde***, ***brown***, and ***gray*** hair. The blond hair can go from ash blond to dark ash shade, but it doesn’t have a gold tone. If you get lots of sun, you can even have some auburn highlights in your hair.

On the other hand, the brown hair can be light, medium, dark, or even a mousy brown with a grayish cast. Most Summers have dusty and muted hair color, but do you know they also gray gracefully to a pearly white or blue-gray tone?

Good ***suit*** colors are ***charcoal and medium gray***, ***cool tans and browns***, and ***light navy blue***. Black may work for you, white will sometimes work.


#### Main Colour: [Autumn](https://infinitcloset.com/4-season-color-analysis/autumn-colour-palette-4-season-color-analysis/)

#### Main Colour: [Winter](https://infinitcloset.com/4-season-color-analysis/winter-colour-palette-4-season-color-analysis/)

You will suit colors that are ***sharp***, ***clear*** and ***high contrast***. Winters can also wear ***black*** and ***pure white*** comfortably. If you feel that black overpowers you, but your overall coloring is cool, then you may fit better into Summer.

***Skin***: Winter skintone is cool or even olive undertones. You may have very light skin and a high contrast level with your hair and eyes, or an overall dark colouring.

***Hair***: Either very light blonde with no warm undertones (platinum, icy blondes) or dark brown to black. Ashy mid-brown brunettes can also fall into this category. The important bit is that there is no golden or copper undertones to the hair, though sometimes there are cool red undertones.

***Eyes***: Cool steel blue, clear blue, cool green or dark brown to black eyes. High contrast between the white of the eyes and the iris, the eyes are bright and jewel-like, not hazy.

The Winter colour palette would suit people who fall into Deep Winter, Cool Winter and Bright Winter in the [12 Season Color Analysis system](https://infinitcloset.com/category/12-seasons-color-analysis/). If you are looking for a more specific palette and your colouring is more neutral than Cool Winter, check Dark or Bright Winter instead.
